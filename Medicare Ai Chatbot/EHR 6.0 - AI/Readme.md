# This project is an AI-powered chatbot system that aims to improve patient-provider relations by giving them a convenient and effective platform. The main goal of this project is to use a virtual assistant that can evaluate patient symptoms and provide early diagnostic reports to streamline the initial medical consultation procedure. Patients and doctors make up the two primary user profiles in the system. Patients communicate with the AI chatbot to report their symptoms, and registered physicians are accessible for follow-up consultations. The AI chatbot uses sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) methods to comprehend patient inputs and uses an extensive medical database to predict possible illnesses. The technology creates a report after determining a likely diagnosis, which the patient can use to make an appointment with a licensed physician. This medical expert cross-verification guarantees the precision and dependability of the AI's initial diagnosis. This system's ability to reliably detect common medical disorders and expedite the consultation process was proved during its development and testing. This project has a huge impact since it provides a scalable way to reduce the burden on healthcare institutions, enhance patient outcomes by providing prompt diagnosis, and make medical advice more accessible to people living in rural or underserved areas.
